**SHOPPING CART** ✔

_Project Description_ ✌

This project includes a small shopping cart through an online API where a customer can add items to cart and they are calculated. Please note that this project is not refined and customer cannot do stuff such as delete from cart, add more than one item at once into the cart, update quantities directly from cart, calculation of taxes, delivery costs etc. These _might_ be implemented later on. This was only a practice example for myself to use VueX.
